# Arduino Code for Ghostbusters Gear Props
This repository is provided as a convenient means to access Arduino code developed as part of custom Ghostbusters-related props developed by Nathan Miller as part of the Ghostbusters Gear account on Instagram and Patreon. https://www.patreon.com/ghostbustersgear

Here you will find Arduino code to support electronics setup for the following props:

- 3D Printed Ghost Trap
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters Neutrona Wand
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters Proton Pack
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters PKE Meter

The electronics are useful samples to demonstrate basic light sequencing and the use of RF modules for remote control action.
