# Arduino Code for Ghostbusters Gear Props
This repository is provided as a convenient means to access Arduino code developed as part of custom Ghostbusters-related props developed by Nathan Miller as part of the Ghostbusters Gear account on Instagram and Patreon.

Here you will find Arduino code to support electronics setup for the following props:

- 3D Printed Ghost Trap
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters Neutrona Wand
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters Proton Pack
- 3D Printed Ghostbusters PKE Meter

The electronics are useful samples to demonstrate basic light sequencing and the use of RF modules for remote control action.
